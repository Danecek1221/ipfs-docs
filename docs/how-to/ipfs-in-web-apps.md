# IPFS in web-applications and resource-constrained environments

In this guide you will learn how to use IPFS in web applications, including addressing, retrieving, and providing.

In this guide, you will use [Helia](https://github.com/ipfs/helia), the most actively maintained TypeScript IPFS library for use on the web and the recommended library for most use cases.

> **Note:** this guide is focused solely on using IPFS for data within a web application. It does _not_ cover using IPFS for static website distribution with IPFS Gateways.

## Challenges with IPFS on the web

IPFS allows you to fetch data by CID from multiple providers without being reliant on a single authoritative server.

However, making all of this work on the web is tricky due to networking constraints. Browsers impose many restrictions on web apps, for example, opening TCP/UDP connections is not possible. Instead, web apps are constrained to HTTP, WebSockets, WebRTC, and most recently WebTransport.

There are good reasons for this like security and resource management, but ultimately, it means that using IPFS on the web is different to native binaries.

## Key IPFS operations: Addressing, Retrieving, and Providing

As a developer, IPFS exposes three main operations for interacting with the network:

- **Addressing data with CIDs** (also known as merklizing): taking arbitrary data and encoding so its addressable by CID. For example, given a file and encoding it so it can be addressed by a CID.
- **Providing data by CID**: making data addressed by a CID retrievable by other peers, either by running a node or with a pinning service.
- **Retrieving data by CID**: given a CID, IPFS finds providers (peers who share the block), connects to them, fetches the blocks, and verifies.

## Addressing data by CID

As mentioned above, the first step in the [lifecycle of data in IPFS](../concepts/lifecycle.md) is to address it by CID.

When addressing data by [CIDs](https://proto.school/anatomy-of-a-cid/03) you will need to choose:

- [hash function](../concepts/glossary.md#hash-function). For use in browsers, the default and recommended hash function is `sha2-256` which is also the default for [helia](https://github.com/ipfs/helia).
- [multicodec](../concepts/glossary.md#multicodec), which is the format of the data you are addressing and is used to help decode data. CIDs support a wide range of multicodecs, but for most intents and purposes, you will likely either want use:
  - [unixfs](../concepts/file-systems.md#unix-file-system-unixfs) for files and directories.
  - [dag-cbor](../concepts/glossary.md#dag-cbor) for json-like structured data with binary encoding. DAG-CBOR is an extension of CBOR that adds a "link" type for CIDs, allowing for the creation of interlinked CBOR objects (which can be used to form larger linked data structures).

### CID Determinism

One important thing to note is that **the same data can result in different CIDs** depending on a number of factors, including the hash function, the multicodec you use, and the multicodec. **This is especially true for files**, where the same file, hash function and multicodec can still result in different CIDs depending on the different options that UnixFS supports. See the [forum discussion](https://discuss.ipfs.tech/t/should-we-profile-cids/18507) for more details.

### Example: Addressing an object by CID with dag-cbor

For example, to address an object by CID with the `dag-cbor` multicodec and `sha2-256` hash function, you can use the following code using [Helia](https://github.com/ipfs/helia):

## Providing data

In the examples above you saw how to address data by CID. But what you do with it depends on your use case.

If you want to data to be retrievable by other peers on [Mainnet](../concepts/glossary.md#ipfs-mainnet) you will want to upload it to a pinning service or an IPFS node you run.

### You probably don't want to provide data from a browser

Browsers make for lousy servers. It's difficult to make a Web page a server, i.e. allow network incoming connections from other computers. There's one exception, namely WebRTC, however, it has many caveats.

For this reason, you should almost never count on providing data from a browser to work.

Instead, you should provide data from a long-running server that runs reliably and has a public IP. That can be a Kubo node that you run, or a [pinning service](../concepts/persistence.md#pinning-services).

### CAR files

CAR files offer a serialized representation of content-addressed resources in one single concatenated stream, alongside a header that describes that content. This makes them a great way to store content-addressed data in a way that is easy to transport and store.

## Retrieval
